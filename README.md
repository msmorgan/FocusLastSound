# FocusLastSound

An incomplete Chromium extension that automatically switches to tabs that begin playing sound.
This behavior is off by default, and is activated by clicking the extension's "browser action" button.

This plugin is incomplete, and was originally written for use with [poe.trade](http://poe.trade/),
with the goal of making it easier to run multiple live searches at once.
